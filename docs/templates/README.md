# Document Templates

This folder contains simple markdown templates for creating common documentation types.

## Available Templates

- **[policy-template.md](policy-template.md)** - For company policies and governance documents
- **[procedure-template.md](procedure-template.md)** - For SOPs, runbooks, and operational procedures
- **[guide-template.md](guide-template.md)** - For how-to guides and tutorials

## How to Use

1. **Copy the template** to the appropriate folder (e.g., `docs/policies/`)
2. **Rename the file** to match your document name
3. **Fill in the sections** with your content
4. **Customize** sections as needed for your specific use case

## Working with AI

These templates work well with both Claude Desktop (MCP) and Claude.ai (Skills):

```
You: "Create a new remote work policy using the policy template"
Claude: [Copies template, fills in sections based on your requirements]
```

## Future Enhancements

These templates are intentionally simple. Future versions may include:
- AI metadata frontmatter for advanced features
- Semantic markers for AI guidance
- Auto-summary generation

See `../../.github/DOCUMENTATION/future-features/` for planned features.
