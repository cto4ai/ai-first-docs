# {{COMPANY_NAME}} Documentation

Welcome to our AI-first documentation repository. This is your central hub for policies, procedures, technical documentation, and guides - powered by intelligent AI-assisted editing.

## ü§ñ AI-First Workflow

This repository is designed for **AI-first documentation editing**. You can interact with your documentation using natural language through AI assistants that understand your organizational context.

### Quick Start Examples
- **"Load the vacation policy into an artifact for editing"**
- **"Update the remote work policy to allow 4-day work weeks"**
- **"Create a new expense policy for travel reimbursements"**
- **"Draft a security policy based on our compliance requirements"**

## üìÅ Repository Structure

- **`docs/policies/`** - Company policies and governance documents
- **`docs/procedures/`** - Standard operating procedures and runbooks
- **`docs/architecture/`** - Technical documentation and system architecture
- **`docs/examples/`** - Example content and templates for reference

## üöÄ Getting Started

### For AI-Powered Editing
1. **Ask your AI assistant** to help with documentation tasks
2. **Use artifacts** for visual editing before committing changes
3. **Review AI-generated content** before it's committed to the repository
4. **AI instructions** are configured in `.claude/DOCUMENT_ASSISTANT.md`

### For Traditional Editing
1. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for documentation guidelines
2. Use templates in `docs/examples/` for new documents
3. Run `npm run validate` before submitting changes

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Validate your documentation
npm run validate

# Check spelling
npm run spell

# Check for broken links
npm run links

# Fix markdown formatting
npm run lint
```

## üìã Quality Assurance

This repository uses automated validation to ensure high-quality documentation:

- **Markdown Linting** - Consistent formatting and structure
- **Spell Checking** - Catches typos and misspellings
- **Link Validation** - Ensures all links work correctly
- **AI Review Integration** - AI-assisted content validation
- **PR Reviews** - All changes reviewed before merge

## üìñ AI-First Best Practices

### Working with AI
1. **Be specific** in your requests - "Update vacation policy to increase PTO by 2 days"
2. **Review all changes** before approving commits
3. **Use artifacts** for complex edits to see changes visually
4. **Provide context** about your organization when creating new content

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Setup

This repository includes pre-configured AI assistant instructions designed for your organization's documentation workflow.

### Claude Desktop Integration

**Set up your Documentation Assistant:**

1. **Copy Master Instructions**
   - Open `.claude/DOCUMENT_ASSISTANT.md` in this repository
   - Copy the entire content to your Claude Desktop Project instructions
   - These instructions are already personalized for {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}

2. **For Claude Team Users**
   - Create a shared "{{ORGANIZATION_NAME}} Documentation" Project
   - Import the instructions to enable team-wide consistent AI assistance
   - All team members can then use the same documentation assistant behavior

3. **Test Your Setup**
   ```
   Try asking: "Load the vacation policy into an artifact for editing"
   Try asking: "Create a new remote work policy for our company"
   ```

### Dual AI Integration

This repository supports two complementary AI workflows:

- **CLAUDE.md**: Configuration for Claude Code integration (technical editing, development workflow)
- **DOCUMENT_ASSISTANT.md**: Instructions for Claude Desktop Projects (business user editing, artifact-based workflow)

Both files work together to provide comprehensive AI-first documentation support.

### Customization Options

The assistant instructions can be customized for {{ORGANIZATION_NAME}}'s specific needs:
- Modify tone and language preferences
- Update approval workflow requirements
- Add compliance and regulatory constraints
- Include organization-specific terminology
