# MCP Architecture Planning

> **Status**: Planning Phase
> **Last Updated**: 2025-09-26
> **Decision Status**: Analysis Complete - Pending Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document captures the analysis and decision process for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to enable AI-first documentation workflows. After evaluating existing MCP servers vs custom development, we've identified a phased approach starting with existing MCPs and evolving based on specific needs.

## Requirements Analysis

### Initial Assumptions
- Started with assumption that existing MCP servers would suffice
- Focused on single repository, technical users scenario
- Underestimated complexity of enterprise requirements

### Evolved Requirements Through Analysis

#### 1. Content Scope Expansion
- **Initial**: Standard documentation (markdown files)
- **Actual**: Documentation + AI prompts + agent personas + workflows
- **Impact**: Multi-content type handling, but all can remain in markdown with frontmatter

#### 2. Multi-Repository Architecture
- **Requirement**: Multiple related repositories
  - `ai-first-docs/` - Documentation repository
  - `ai-prompts/` - Prompt library repository
  - `ai-agents/` - Agent personas repository
  - Additional workflow/template repositories
- **Challenge**: Cross-repo relationships, unified search, coordinated updates
- **Complexity Factor**: High - existing MCPs are single-repo focused

#### 3. Non-Technical User Base
- **Requirement**: Majority of users will be non-technical Claude.ai/Desktop users
- **Challenge**: Seamless authentication without technical GitHub setup
- **Initial Concern**: Complex SSO/auth infrastructure needed
- **Solution Discovery**: Individual Personal Access Tokens (PATs) per user

#### 4. User-Level Revision Tracking
- **Requirement**: All changes must be attributed to actual users, not service accounts
- **Initial Concern**: Complex custom attribution system needed
- **Solution Discovery**: Individual PATs provide native GitHub attribution
- **Result**: Git commits show real users, full audit trail maintained

### Final Requirements Matrix

| Requirement | Complexity | Existing MCP Support | Custom MCP Needed |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Markdown + frontmatter content | Low | ✅ Full support | ❌ Not needed |
| User attribution via PATs | Medium | ✅ Native GitHub | ❌ Not needed |
| Single repository operations | Low | ✅ Full support | ❌ Not needed |
| Multi-repository coordination | High | ❌ Limited | ✅ Significant value |
| Cross-repo search/relationships | High | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Significant value |
| Non-technical user onboarding | Medium | ⚠️ PAT setup required | ✅ Could simplify |

## Architecture Options

### Option A: Existing MCP Servers with Individual PATs

**Implementation:**
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docs-repo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${USER_GITHUB_PAT}",
        "REPO": "cto4ai/ai-first-docs"
      }
    },
    "prompts-repo": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "${USER_GITHUB_PAT}",
        "REPO": "cto4ai/ai-prompts"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Immediate implementation (hours, not weeks)
- ✅ Community-tested, maintained solutions
- ✅ Native user attribution through GitHub
- ✅ Standard GitHub permissions model
- ✅ Zero custom development/maintenance

**Cons:**
- ❌ No cross-repo coordination
- ❌ Separate MCP connections per repo
- ❌ No unified search across repositories
- ❌ PAT setup burden on non-technical users
- ❌ Limited relationship understanding between repos

**Best For:**
- Proving AI-first concept quickly
- Small team validation
- Simple multi-repo scenarios

### Option B: Custom MCP Server

**Implementation:**
```javascript
class AIFirstDocsMCP {
  constructor() {
    this.repositories = [
      { name: 'docs', url: 'cto4ai/ai-first-docs' },
      { name: 'prompts', url: 'cto4ai/ai-prompts' },
      { name: 'agents', url: 'cto4ai/ai-agents' }
    ];
  }

  async tools() {
    return [
      {
        name: 'cross_repo_search',
        description: 'Search across all related repositories',
        parameters: { query: 'string', repos: 'array' }
      },
      {
        name: 'update_related_content',
        description: 'Update content with cross-repo awareness',
        parameters: { changes: 'array', validate_relationships: 'boolean' }
      }
    ];
  }
}
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Unified interface across all repositories
- ✅ Cross-repo relationship understanding
- ✅ Coordinated updates across repos
- ✅ Could simplify user onboarding
- ✅ Custom business logic and validation
- ✅ Optimized for specific workflow patterns

**Cons:**
- ❌ Weeks/months of development time
- ❌ Ongoing maintenance burden
- ❌ Security responsibility
- ❌ Testing and reliability challenges
- ❌ Feature parity with existing solutions

**Best For:**
- Complex multi-repo workflows
- Large-scale deployments
- Specialized business requirements

### Option C: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

**Phase 1: Existing MCP Validation**
- Deploy existing MCPs with individual PATs
- Test AI-first workflows with technical team
- Identify specific gaps and pain points
- Measure usage patterns and bottlenecks

**Phase 2: Targeted Custom Tools**
- Keep existing MCPs as foundation
- Add specific custom tools for identified gaps
- Focus on cross-repo coordination where needed
- Incremental improvement based on real usage

**Phase 3: Full Custom MCP (If Needed)**
- Migrate to custom MCP only if clear value demonstrated
- Retain existing MCP capabilities
- Focus custom development on unique requirements

## Authentication & User Management

### Individual PAT Approach

**User Onboarding Process:**
1. **GitHub Account Setup**
   - Create GitHub account (if needed)
   - Add to organization and appropriate teams
   - Set repository permissions based on role

2. **PAT Generation**
   - Generate Personal Access Token with required scopes
   - Document token management (rotation, expiry)
   - Provide secure token delivery method

3. **Claude Desktop Configuration**
   - Provide pre-configured MCP settings
   - User adds their PAT to configuration
   - Test connection and permissions

4. **Training & Documentation**
   - AI-first workflow training
   - Basic Git/GitHub concepts for non-technical users
   - Support and troubleshooting resources

**Advantages:**
- Native GitHub user attribution
- Standard GitHub permission model
- Individual accountability and audit trail
- No custom authentication infrastructure

**Challenges:**
- PAT setup complexity for non-technical users
- Token management and rotation
- Support burden for authentication issues

- Team capacity for ongoing maintenance

## Decision Framework

### When to Stay with Existing MCPs
- ✅ Workflows function adequately with separate repo connections
- ✅ Team comfortable with multi-MCP configuration
- ✅ Cross-repo coordination needs are minimal
- ✅ PAT onboarding process proves manageable

### When to Develop Custom MCP
- ❌ Cross-repo workflows become major productivity bottleneck
- ❌ User onboarding becomes significant support burden
- ❌ Complex business logic requirements emerge
- ❌ Scale requires performance optimization

### Hybrid Indicators
- ⚠️ Some workflows benefit from custom tools
- ⚠️ Specific integration requirements
- ⚠️ Gradual improvement approach preferred
- ⚠️ Risk mitigation through incremental development

## Risk Assessment

### Existing MCP Risks
- **Low Technical Risk**: Community-maintained, tested solutions
- **Medium User Experience Risk**: Multi-repo configuration complexity
- **Medium Scalability Risk**: May not scale to complex workflows
- **Low Maintenance Risk**: External maintenance

### Custom MCP Risks
- **High Technical Risk**: Custom development, testing, security
- **Low User Experience Risk**: Optimized for specific workflows
- **Low Scalability Risk**: Built for requirements
- **High Maintenance Risk**: Ongoing development and support
