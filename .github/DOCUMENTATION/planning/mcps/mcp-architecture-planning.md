# MCP Architecture Planning

> **Status**: Planning Phase
> **Last Updated**: 2025-09-26
> **Decision Status**: Analysis Complete - Pending Implementation

## Executive Summary

This document captures the analysis and decision process for implementing Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration to enable AI-first documentation workflows. After evaluating existing MCP servers vs custom development, we've identified a phased approach starting with existing MCPs and evolving based on specific needs.

## Requirements Analysis

### Initial Assumptions

- Started with assumption that existing MCP servers would suffice
- Focused on single repository, technical users scenario
- Underestimated complexity of enterprise requirements

### Evolved Requirements Through Analysis

#### 1. Content Scope Expansion

- **Initial**: Standard documentation (markdown files)
- **Actual**: Documentation + AI prompts + agent personas + workflows
- **Impact**: Multi-content type handling, but all can remain in markdown with frontmatter

#### 2. Multi-Repository Architecture

- **Requirement**: Multiple related repositories
  - `ai-first-docs/` - Documentation repository
  - `ai-prompts/` - Prompt library repository
  - `ai-agents/` - Agent personas repository
  - Additional workflow/template repositories
- **Challenge**: Cross-repo relationships, unified search, coordinated updates
- **Complexity Factor**: High - existing MCPs are single-repo focused

#### 3. Non-Technical User Base

- **Requirement**: Majority of users will be non-technical Claude.ai/Desktop users
- **Challenge**: Seamless authentication without technical GitHub setup
- **Initial Concern**: Complex SSO/auth infrastructure needed
- **Solution Discovery**: Individual Personal Access Tokens (PATs) per user

#### 4. User-Level Revision Tracking

- **Requirement**: All changes must be attributed to actual users, not service accounts
- **Initial Concern**: Complex custom attribution system needed
- **Solution Discovery**: Individual PATs provide native GitHub attribution
- **Result**: Git commits show real users, full audit trail maintained

### Final Requirements Matrix

| Requirement | Complexity | Existing MCP Support | Custom MCP Needed |
|-------------|------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Markdown + frontmatter content | Low | ✅ Full support | ❌ Not needed |
| User attribution via PATs | Medium | ✅ Native GitHub | ❌ Not needed |
| Single repository operations | Low | ✅ Full support | ❌ Not needed |
| Multi-repository coordination | High | ❌ Limited | ✅ Significant value |
| Cross-repo search/relationships | High | ❌ Not supported | ✅ Significant value |
| Non-technical user onboarding | Medium | ⚠️ PAT setup required | ✅ Could simplify |

## Architecture Options

## User Workflow: Policy Document Editing

This section details the exact user experience for editing a policy document through Claude Desktop with MCP integration, demonstrating how the AI-first approach eliminates technical complexity while maintaining full version control.

### Complete User Journey

#### Step 1: User Initiates Request

**User Experience:**

```text
User in Claude Desktop: "I need to update our vacation policy to include the new remote work guidelines"
```

**System State:**

- User has Claude Desktop with configured MCP connection
- User's Personal Access Token provides GitHub access
- No local Git repository or files required
- No technical knowledge of repository structure needed

#### Step 2: File Discovery via MCP

**User Experience:**

```text
Claude: "I found your vacation policy document in the repository. Let me read the current version first..."

Current Policy:
- 15 days PTO for new employees
- 20 days after 2 years
- 25 days after 5 years
- Must be approved 2 weeks in advance

What specific remote work guidelines would you like me to add?
```

**Technical Flow:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Claude Desktop] --> B[GitHub MCP Server]
    B --> C[GitHub API]
    C --> D[Repository Search]
    D --> E[File: docs/policies/vacation-policy.md]
    E --> F[Content Loaded to Claude]
```

**Behind the Scenes:**

- MCP searches repository contents for vacation/PTO/policy matches
- Identifies `docs/policies/vacation-policy.md` as most relevant
- Loads current content into Claude's context
- User sees existing policy without knowing file paths or Git commands

#### Step 3: Interactive Content Development

**User Experience:**

```text
User: "Add a section about remote work eligibility. Employees with 6+ months tenure can work remotely up to 2 days per week, with manager approval."

Claude: "Perfect! I'll add this as a new section. Here's how I propose to structure it:

## Remote Work Policy
- Eligible: Employees with 6+ months tenure
- Limit: Up to 2 days per week
- Approval: Manager approval required
- Guidelines: Must maintain communication standards

Should I add this after the PTO accrual section?"

User: "Yes, and also mention they need to be in good performance standing."

Claude: "Great addition! I'll include that requirement."
```

**System State:**

- All editing occurs in conversation context
- No local files created or modified
- Claude maintains full file content in memory
- User reviews and refines changes interactively

#### Step 4: Direct Repository Update via MCP

**User Experience:**

```text
Claude: "I've updated the vacation policy with the new remote work guidelines. The changes are now live in the repository. Here's what I added:

[Shows the exact changes made]

The policy is immediately available to all team members. Would you like me to:
1. Create a summary for announcing this policy update?
2. Check if other policies need similar remote work updates?
3. Review the change history?"
```

**Technical Flow:**

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Claude Desktop] --> B[Updated Content]
    B --> C[GitHub MCP Server]
    C --> D[GitHub API]
    D --> E[Create Commit]
    E --> F[Repository Updated]
    F --> G[Native Git History]

    style E fill:#e1f5fe
    style G fill:#e8f5e8
```

**Behind the Scenes:**

- Claude prepares complete updated file content
- MCP commits directly to repository via GitHub API
- Commit metadata includes user attribution and AI context
- No local Git operations required

#### Step 5: Verification and Follow-up

**User Experience:**

```text
Claude: "The vacation policy has been updated successfully. I can see the change in the repository history:

Commit: Update vacation policy with remote work eligibility guidelines
Author: jane.smith <jane.smith@company.com>
Date: 2025-09-26 10:30:00

#### Advanced Scenarios

**Branch and Pull Request Creation:**

```text
User: "I need to completely rewrite our security policy - this is a major change."

Claude: "Since this is a significant policy change, I recommend creating a branch and pull request for review. I'll:

1. Create a new branch: feature/security-policy-rewrite
2. Make the changes on that branch
3. Create a pull request for team review
4. Tag appropriate reviewers based on the policy type

This ensures proper oversight for major policy changes. Should I proceed?"

User: "Yes, and make sure to tag the security team for review."

Claude: "Perfect! I've created branch 'feature/security-policy-rewrite' and I'll tag @security-team as reviewers when I create the PR."
```

**Cross-Repository Updates:**

```text
User: "When I updated the vacation policy, I think our employee handbook might reference the old remote work rules."

Claude: "Let me check the employee handbook repository... I found two references that need updating:

1. In handbook/benefits/time-off.md - references old remote work policy
2. In handbook/quick-reference/policies.md - summary needs updating

Should I update both repositories to keep everything consistent?"
```

### Error Handling and Edge Cases

#### Permission Issues

```text
Claude: "I tried to update the policy, but it looks like you don't have write permissions to this repository. I can:

1. Create the changes as a draft for you to review
2. Help you request access from the repository admin
3. Create the changes in a fork if you have one

Which would you prefer?"
```

#### Conflict Resolution

```text
Claude: "It looks like someone else updated this file while we were working on it. The changes are:

[Shows conflicting changes]

I can:
1. Merge our changes with theirs automatically
2. Create a branch with our changes for manual review
3. Show you both versions so you can decide

What would you like me to do?"
```

#### Validation Failures

```text
Claude: "I've prepared the policy update, but the repository's validation checks found some issues:

- Spell check: 'eligibility' was misspelled as 'eligibilty'
- Link check: Reference to old policy URL is broken
- Markdown lint: Missing blank line after header

I can fix these automatically before committing. Should I proceed?"
```

## Artifact Integration Enhancement

Based on confirmed technical capabilities, Claude Desktop can extract artifact content and save as markdown files, enabling a powerful visual editing enhancement to the AI-first documentation workflow.

### Technical Feasibility Confirmed

**Claude's Artifact Capabilities:**

- ✅ **Content Extraction**: Claude can programmatically access artifact content
- ✅ **Markdown Export**: Claude can save artifact content as properly formatted markdown files
- ✅ **File System Access**: Claude can write extracted content to local or remote destinations

This confirms that bidirectional artifact ↔ repository integration is technically feasible using existing MCP servers with intelligent prompting workflows.

### Enhanced User Workflow with Artifacts

#### Step-by-Step Artifact-Enabled Process

**1. Load Repository Content to Artifact**

```text
User: "Load the vacation policy into an artifact so I can edit it visually"

Claude: [Calls MCP to read file] → [Creates editable artifact with current policy content]

User sees: Rich, formatted document in artifact interface with proper headings, lists, and structure
```

**2. Visual Editing in Artifact**

```text
User: [Edits directly in artifact interface]
- Modifies text using rich formatting
- Adds new sections with proper structure
- Uses artifact's visual editing capabilities
- Sees real-time formatted preview
```

**3. Seamless Repository Commit**

```text
User: "This looks perfect! Commit the updated policy to the repository."

Claude:
1. Extracts artifact content as markdown ✅
2. Calls MCP server with extracted content ✅
3. Commits to repository with user attribution ✅
4. Confirms successful update ✅
```

### Artifact Integration Implementation Options

#### Option A: Prompt-Driven Workflow with Existing MCPs ✅ **RECOMMENDED**

**No custom MCP development required!** This approach uses existing GitHub MCP servers with intelligent prompting:

```text
User: "Edit the vacation policy"

Claude Workflow:
1. Call existing GitHub MCP `get_file_contents` ✅
2. Create artifact with returned content ✅
3. Present visual editing interface ✅
4. When user says "commit": extract artifact content ✅
5. Call existing GitHub MCP `create_or_update_file` ✅
```

**Key Insight**: MCP servers don't need to be "artifact-aware" - they just provide content in/out while Claude handles artifact creation and extraction through existing capabilities.

#### Option B: Custom MCP Tools for Advanced Features

**Only needed for advanced scenarios** that require specialized artifact integration:

```javascript
{
  name: 'create_document_template',
  description: 'Generate structured artifact template for document type',
  parameters: {
    document_type: 'enum', // policy, sop, architecture, prompt
    metadata: 'object' // frontmatter fields to include
  }
},
{
  name: 'cross_repo_artifact_coordination',
  description: 'Create coordinated artifacts across multiple repositories',
  parameters: {
    primary_file_path: 'string',
    related_repositories: 'array'
  }
}
```

### User Experience Benefits

#### Visual Editing Interface

- **Rich Formatting**: Headers, lists, tables, links rendered visually
- **Real-time Preview**: See exactly how document will appear
- **Structured Templates**: Form-based editing for consistent document structure
- **Multi-section Navigation**: Easy jumping between document sections

#### Seamless Version Control

- **Zero Git Complexity**: Visual editing with full version control
- **Professional Commits**: Proper attribution and commit messages
- **Change Visualization**: Before/after comparison in artifact interface
- **Instant Publishing**: Changes immediately available to team

#### Enhanced Productivity

- **Faster Editing**: Visual interface vs conversational back-and-forth
- **Reduced Errors**: Template validation and structured input
- **Collaborative Review**: Artifacts can be shared for feedback before commit
- **Content Templates**: Reusable templates for different document types

#### Document Template System

**Policy Template Artifact:**

```yaml
# Artifact generates form-based interface
fields:
  - name: title
    type: text
    required: true
  - name: purpose
    type: textarea
    placeholder: "Why does this policy exist?"
  - name: scope
    type: textarea
    placeholder: "Who does this apply to?"
  - name: requirements
    type: list
    item_type: text
  - name: owner
    type: select
    options: [hr, security, engineering, legal]

# Auto-generates frontmatter:
frontmatter:
  id: POL-{auto-increment}
  type: policy
  owner: {selected_owner}
  created: {current_date}
  ai_editable: true
```

### Advanced Scenarios

#### Multi-Document Coordination (**Custom MCP Required**)

```text
User: "I updated the vacation policy artifact. Are there other documents that reference this?"

Claude (with Custom MCP):
1. Commits artifact changes to vacation policy ✅
2. Scans related repositories for references ✅ **Requires Custom MCP**
3. Creates artifacts for each document needing updates ✅ **Requires Custom MCP**
4. User reviews and approves cross-repo changes ✅
5. Commits coordinated updates across repositories ✅ **Requires Custom MCP**
```

**Note**: This advanced scenario requires custom MCP development for multi-repository coordination.

#### Approval Workflow Integration

```text
User: "This is a sensitive policy change - create a PR for review"

Claude:
1. Extracts artifact content ✅
2. Creates feature branch ✅
3. Commits artifact content to branch ✅
4. Creates pull request with proper reviewers ✅
5. Provides PR link for team review ✅
```
